### Hello there! 👋

My name is Erick Ponce and I’m a passionate software developer. I’m currently living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 🇧🇷

🕐 During more than 11 years, I have been acquiring experience with various technologies like Java, NodeJs, TypeScript, React, React Native, Python, PhP, Ruby, MySQL, Redis, PostgresSQL, Angular, VueJS, Docker, Kubernetes, Hadoop, OOP, AWS among others.   
🎓 I also have a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Serra dos Órgãos University.

❤️ I’m passionate in building highly scalable and performant software, and I also see software engineering as an art. I put design first, software not only needs to work, but needs to amaze 💅 people.

🔭 I’m currently working as a Senior Software Developer, where I help developing and supporting a team of engineers in building softwares for multiple platforms that scales to thousands of users all over Brazil. I’m a great enthusiast of real time technologies, and have builded a system that handles more than 300 thousands concurrent connections everyday. 🏎

🌱 Getting to know new technologies and deliver great user experiences is what drives me!

I’m also passionate in:

🎮 Video games
